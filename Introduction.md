<h3>1 . Power-cut Schedule Management:</h3>
Due to recent routine power outages, EG has decided to post all power outage timetables on its website. Customers might select their region and learn when the power outage will occur on that given day.

<h3>2 . Monthly Units Management:</h3>
This service is used to store all the users' monthly unit details in a single database. We primarily focus on inserting, removing, updating, and examining all of their user account's unit details. The users' monthly electricity bills are generated using these records

<h3>3 . User Management:</h3>
This system will be used to manage all the details of Systemâ€™s user information. The user can enter all the information about the users. They can also change and delete the user profile as needed. In addition, the system can display all of the users' profile details that have been entered. The data of a user's profile can be viewed by registered users. Similarly, non-registered users can create a new user profile by entering their information. Finally, users can exit the system by using the logout button.

Private Sector management mainly focuses primarily in the collection of electricity from household and small companies. In here the electricity generated by households and small companies are sold to the electricity board. And this electricity buys by electricity board.
